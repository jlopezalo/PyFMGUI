## Currently the version in active development is located in the following fork: 
https://github.com/DyNaMo-INSERM/PyFMGUI_DyNaMo.git

Here you will find the latest release of the code being maintained by the team at the DyNaMo-INSERM lab.

## Introduction
PyFMGUI is an application for the analysis of force microscopy data capable of analyzing Nanoscope and JPK AFM files.

The following analysis routines are supported:
- Thermal tune calibration (JPK .tnd files)
- Elastic fit (Hertz Model fit)
- Viscoelastic fit
- Piezo characterization
- Viscous drag correction
- Microrheology (DMA) analysis

If you have any suggestions, comments or experience any issues. Please open an issue on this repository.

To run, extract the contents of the .zip and run the main.exe file.

## To run from source
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jlopezalo/PyFMGUI.git
cd ./PyFMGUI
```
- Create an environment with python 3.9
```
conda create -n yourenvname python=3.9 
conda activate yourenvname
```

- Install the dependencies from requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python src/main.py
```

## Generate executables
If you wish to do any changes to the code and freeze them. You can use PyInstaller and run the main.spec file (Windows).
```
python -m PyInstaller main.spec
```

## To Do
- Generate documentation with examples and tutorials
- Improve multiprocessing
- Improve tree control for files (allow to load multiple directories at once and assign folder as group)
